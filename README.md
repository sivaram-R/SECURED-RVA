## Title of the Project
## Secured Voting Application

The Secured Voting Application project is designed to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly voting platform, leveraging SHA-256 encryption and UIDAI integration to authenticate voters and ensure data integrity throughout the voting process.

## About
The Secured Voting Application enhances traditional voting systems by incorporating modern cryptographic techniques and government-based authentication to protect voter privacy and validate identities. It minimizes the risk of data tampering or voter fraud, aiming to create a secure voting platform accessible to users.

## Features

1.SHA-256 encryption for secure data handling.
2.Integration with the UIDAI API for user authentication.
3.User-friendly interface for seamless interaction and ease of access.
4.High scalability for extensive user base handling.
5.JSON data format for structured responses and compatibility.

## Requirements

1.Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with the authentication and encryption frameworks.            
2.Development Environment: Python 3.7 or later.           
3.Security Libraries: hashlib for SHA-256 implementation, PyCrypto for advanced cryptographic tasks.         
4.API Integration Libraries: Requests library for interfacing with UIDAI API.           
5.Database Management: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for secure data storage.          
6.Version Control: Git for collaborative development and efficient code management.           
7.IDE: VSCode for streamlined coding, debugging, and version control integration.                  
8.Additional Dependencies: Includes Flask for backend API setup, and RESTful API libraries for secure interactions with frontend.
